- **Prompt** — the text or question you give to an AI model to get a response.  
- **Prompt Engineering** — the skill of writing good prompts so the model gives the best answer.  
- **Fine-tuning** — training a model on extra data to make it better for a specific task.  
- **LLM (Large Language Model)** — a big neural network trained on massive amounts of text.  
- **Transformer** — the main neural network design used in modern AI models.  
- **Hallucination** — when AI gives wrong or made-up information.
